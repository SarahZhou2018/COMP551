# COMP551 Applied Machine Learning 

This repository contains the code and reports for the mini-projects done in McGill University's Applied Machine Learning course in Winter 2020.

## Project 1
The given task was to implement 2 classification models: KNN and Decision Tree with appropriate cost function in order to classify targets from 2 datasets acquired from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php), namely [Breast Cancer dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) and [Hepatitis dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Hepatitis).

A [report](project1/writeup.pdf) was written to indicate our results and findings.

## Project 2
The given task was to classify textual data by implementing Naive Bayes and K-fold cross-validation from scratch using logistic regression from scikit-learn package. The model was trained on two datasets: [20 newsgroup](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups.html?highlight=newsgroup#sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups) and [IMDB Reviews](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). We performed hyperparameter tuning using randomized search with cross validation to achieve the best possible performance for each model. 

A [report](project2/writeup.pdf) was written to indicate our results and findings.

## Project 3
The given task was to implement a Multilayer Perceptron from scratch, including its backpropagation and a mini-batch gradient descent algorithm. Additionally, we were to develop a Convolutional Neural Network. The accuracies and losses of training and validation splits were recorded during training. We compared both models and their performance.

A [report](project3/writeup.pdf) was written to indicate our results and findings.

## Project 4
The given task was to reproduce selected experiments from a paper. 

A [report](project4/writeup.pdf) was written to indicate our results and findings.
